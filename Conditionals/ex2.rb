# Unpredictable Weather (Part 2)

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

# Write an unless statement that prints "The clouds are blocking the sun!" 
# unless sun equals 'visible'.

puts "The clouds are blocking the sun" unless sun == "visible"

# Same rationale as ex1, but with an unless statement rather than an if 
# statement.
