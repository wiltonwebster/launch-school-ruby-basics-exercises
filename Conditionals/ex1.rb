# Unpredictable Weather (Part 1)

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun is visible.

puts "The sun is so bright!" if sun == "visible"

# One line if statement is appropriate, since we have a single line of code to 
# execute if true and no code to execute if not.
