# Tricky Formatting

state = "tExAs"

# Correct the capitalization of state and print it. (Modify the object.)

state.capitalize!

puts state

# The .capitalize method upcases the first element of the string and downcases 
# the other elements. Using the ! after the method name mutates the calling 
# object, so that the corrected value is stored in state.
