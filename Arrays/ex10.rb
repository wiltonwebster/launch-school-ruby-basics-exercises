# Are We The Same?

array1 = [1, 5, 9]
array2 = [1, 9, 5]

# Compare array1 and array2 and print true or false based on if they match.

# Arrays are ordered sets of values (unlike hashes), so these arrays will not be
# equal to one another.

puts (array1 == array2)

# Since the output only needs to be true or false, we can simply use puts on the
# output of the comparison.
